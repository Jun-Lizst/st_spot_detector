# ST Spot Detector

A web tool for automatic spot detection and positional adjustments for ST datasets. 

The arrays used to generate ST datasets may contain positional variations due to printing artifacts. This web tool aims to detect correct spot positions using the images generated from the ST protocol.
In order to obtain relevant experimental data, it is also possible to automatically select the spots which are located under the tissue, using a corresponding HE image.
The spot positions and selections are further adjustable to one's own needs.
A file is generated which contains the corrected spot coordinates of the ST data as adjusted array coordinates and pixel coordinates as well as file containing a 3x3 affine matrix to transform array coordinates to pixel coordinates which can be useful for downstream analysis.

## Dependencies
The server uses Python 2.7 with the libraries OpenCV-Python and Pillow (PIL Fork) for image processing. These can easily be installed within a virtual environment using pip and requirements.txt (see Usage).
It also uses another [tissue recognition library](https://github.com/SpatialTranscriptomicsResearch/st_tissue_recognition). 

A modern browser with HTML5 support is required for the front-end interface. The web app has been tested on the lastest version of Chrome and Firefox.

## Usage

If you want to use deploy the ST Spot detector locally on your computer
you can use this [singularity](https://github.com/SpatialTranscriptomicsResearch/st_spot_detector_singularity)
container. Otherwise follow the deployment instructions below.

### Download
1. Clone the repository

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/SpatialTranscriptomicsResearch/st_spot_detector.git
    ```
2. Move into the directory
    ```
    cd st_spot_detector
    ```

### Server setup (all `pip` and `Python` commands assume Python 2)
1. Install the necessary packages (OS-dependent command)
    e.g. on Ubuntu/Debian
    ```
        sudo apt install python2.7 python-pip nodejs npm make
    ```

2. Create and activate a Python virtual environment 

    ```
    pip install virtualenv
    virtualenv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. Install the dependencies in requirements.txt.

    ```
    cd server
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Install the tissue recognition library (still within the Python virtual environment). Follow the instructions [here.](https://github.com/SpatialTranscriptomicsResearch/st_tissue_recognition)

5. Build the client side files
    The client side uses the Node.js package manager and a Makefile to build

    ```
    cd ../client
    npm install
    make DEVEL=1
    ```

6. Set up uWSGI
    a uWSGI daemon can be installed, e.g. on Ubuntu/Debian
    ```
    sudo apt install uwsgi uwsgi-core uwsgi-plugin-python
    ```
    or it may be installed within the Python virtual environment
    ```
    pip install uwsgi
    ```
    NOTE: the application may also be run directly as a Bottle application but performance is limited:
    ```
    cd ../server
    python server.py
    ```

7. Edit the uWSGI configuration file uwsg-server-config.ini
    The following lines require editing
    ```
    chdir = /path/to/server/file/directory/
    logto = /path/to/log/file/directory/%n.log
    plugin = /path/to/python/plugin/ 
    virtualenv = /path/to/virtual/env
    ```

    They may for example look like
    ```
    chdir = /home/user/st_spot_detector/server
    logto = /home/user/.st_log/%n.log
    plugin = /usr/lib/uwsgi/plugins/python_plugin.so
    virtualenv = /home/user/st_spot_detector/venv/
    ```

8. Run the server
    uWSGI may then either be daemonized, e.g. on Ubuntu/Debian

    ```
    # the file must be copied to the uwsgi directory
    sudo cp uwsgi-server-config.ini /etc/uwsgi/apps-available/
    # and symlinked to the apps-enabled folder
    sudo ln -s /etc/uwsgi/apps-available/uwsgi-server-config.ini /etc/uwsgi/apps-enabled/uwsgi-server-config.ini
    # then the service may be started
    sudo service uwsgi start
    ```
    or run locally
    ```
    uwsgi uwsgi-server-config.ini
    ```

9. Optional
    The server may be configured to run with nginx or Apache (not covered here).
    It may also be desirable to configure port-forwarding to be able to access the web tool through port 80, e.g. on Ubuntu/Debian
    ```
    sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -i eth0 -j DNAT --to 0.0.0.0:8080

    ```
