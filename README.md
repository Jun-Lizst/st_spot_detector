# ST Alignment 

A web tool to do automatic spot detections and positional adjustments for ST Datasets. 
The arrays used to generate ST Datasets may contain positional variations due to
printing artifacts. This web tool aims to detect the correct position using the HE image
with the overlay of the spots and then generate a file that can be used to adjust
the coordinates of ST data.

NOTE that this software is not functional yet as it is in an early stage of development.
